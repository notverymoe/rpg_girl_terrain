# BF_COLLINEAR

Some operations with collinear faces creates
degenerate faces. These issue do not seem to
affect printability, so it was only fixed in
the core designs. The sample files containing
decorative elements would take more time than
it's worth.

Appears related to negative scales or mirror
operations. The current solutions just offsets
some surfaces or makes elements slightly thicker.
